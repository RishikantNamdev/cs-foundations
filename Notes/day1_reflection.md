# Day 1 Reflection

What confused me today:
I initially had a shallow understanding of how const works with pointers and references, especially the difference between const objects and const pointers. Clarifying this improved my understanding of C++ API design.

What felt solid:
Pass by value vs pass by reference, basic SQL queries, and the mental model of processes vs threads felt clear and intuitive by the end of the day.

One mistake I made:
I used casual language and imprecise terms in my first version of technical notes, which reduced clarity and professionalism.

One thing I will fix tomorrow:
I will focus on using precise terminology and cleaner explanations from the first draft instead of relying on later corrections.
